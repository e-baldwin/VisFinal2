    <p class = "explanation">
        The United States uses and produces a variety of energy sources, which can 
        be categorized into primary and secondary, renewable and nonrenewable, and fossil fuels.
        <br> 
        <br>Primary energy sources include fossil fuels (petroleum, natural gas, and coal), nuclear energy, and renewable sources of energy. 
        As such, electricity is a secondary energy source that is produced from primary energy sources.
        <br> 
        <br>Energy sources are measured in different physical units, such as liquid fuels in barrels or gallons, natural gas in cubic feet, 
        coal in short tons, and electricity in kilowatts and kilowatthours. Additionally, British Thermal Units (Btu), are a unit of heat
        that is a customary unit in the United States used to compare different types of energy.

        The visualization above is a stacked bar chart that displays the energy consumption in the United States. The bar chart is divded into different sectors, Residential, Transportation, and Industrial.
        Each sector has a distinct color as seen in the legend which can be clicked to highlight a specific sector. 
        The data is displayed from the years 1949-2020. It is clear in the visualization that energy consumption has been gradually increasing across all three sectors.

        In modern America energy consumption is a part of our everyday lives. From driving your car to work, or to charging your 
        smartphone at night, energy is constantly being used throughout our days. However, there are repercussions to this constant 
        energy use, especially on our environment.

        The visualizations above display CO2 Emissions. The emissions are divided and displayed individually in an area chart.
         Each emission has a distinct color that is visible in the legend. The legend colors highlight each distinct emission sector if the color is selected.
         The visualization spans the years 1974-2020. Throughout the visualization there is a steady rise in emissions. The different rises and dips in CO2 emissions could be due to many aspects.
        <br> 
        <br>As seen in the graph (use the view below for a better breakdown) above, the short-term 
        drop during 2020 in carbon-dioxide emissions for all sectors can be attributed to the COVID-19 
        pandemic which dramatically impacted economic production.
        <br><br>
        In the United States, the majority of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions primarily come from the burning of fossil fuels, 
        natural gas, and petroleum for energy. Some variables that effect greenhouse gas emissions are weather patterns, 
        which can impact energy usage with regards to heating and cooling, as well as economic growth. Additionally, 
        energy prices, as well as government legislation may also limit how much energy can be consumed.

    <p class = "explanation">
        Since energy consumption has been increasing throughout the years, we looked at possible correlations. 
        A possible indicator was population, since, as population increases, so would total energy consumption. 
        One visualization above displays the population growth rate in the United States. This population growth rate has been steadily increasing.
         An increase in population means there are more people consuming energy. A rise in energy consumption could be due to the rising population.
<br><br>
        After this, we examined the trends for economic growth. 
        We hypothesized that as countries continue to increase production because the production of goods uses energy from various sources.

        A way to examine economic production and productivity is through the examination of Gross Domestic Product. 
        Gross Domestic Product is the standard measure of the value added created through the production of goods and services in a country, so we believe it is a good measurement for economic growth.

        The second visualization above allows us to see that Real GDP in the United States is increasing. 
        <br><br>
        The trend lines for population growth rate and real GDP in the United States correlate to the energy consumption rates in the United States.
        It is clear that factors such as, population and economic growth contribute to CO2 emissions and energy consumption in the United States.
    </p>
    <p class = "largeTitle" id = "conclusion">Takeaways</p>
    <p class = "explanation">
        In conclusion, we learned that energy consumption has increased over the time span we observed. 

        We can see that as population growth and economic growth increase, energy consumption also increases. However, it is understood that those aspects cannot be controlled in order to decrease energy consumption.
        Interestingly, carbon emissions have reduced over the last decade while energy consumption increases. This could be due to new green forms of energy.  
        <br><br>Something about temperatures?
        <br> 
        <br>Energy consumption will continue to increase as we continue to have technological progress. However, with greener 
        forms of energy such as wind, solar, and water, we can minimize the impact that energy consumption has on the environment.
        With more efficient systems as well as global legislation and collaborative efforts to reduce these emissions, we can see
        that there is truly a bright future in store for us and our planet.
