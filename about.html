                    We did our project on energy consumption in the United States and it's effects on the world today. 
                    Because energy is a constant requirement of our everyday lives, we thought it would be interesting to 
                    analyze how it is used on the national scale and see how it impacts our environment as well.

                    Our first graph shows the total energy consumption over time for the United States. 
                    It's implemented as a stacked bar chart to show the energy in different sectors.
                    Our second graph is a stacked area chart which shows the CO2 emissions by sector. 
                    The last two graphs show the US population growth compared with the economic growth over time. 
                    It explores those variables as possible causes of the increase in energy consumption.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Energy consumption will continue to increase as long as we have technological development and economic production.
                    Despite this, our country's carbon emissions have decreased, which is a promising sign for our environmental 
                    conservation efforts.

                    It was difficult to use the data at first, because of how we wanted to structure our visualizations, so we ended up with multiple csv files that reformat the data.
                    It took us awhile to figure out how to implement it smoothly and have the files complement each other. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    It was challenging to coordinate the visualizations together to tell a story. As a result of many trials and errors, we 
                    managed to create a more cohesive webpage.

                    The workload was divided evenly between the group members. We all made contributions to the website through finding
                    the datasets, creating the visualizations, and implementing stylistic elements of the page.
