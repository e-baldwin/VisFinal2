                We did our project on energy consumption and it's effects on the world today. 
                We thought it could be cool to visualize, since this topic is relevant to many people.

                Our first graph shows the total energy consumption over time for the United States. 
                It's implemented as a stacked bar chart to show the energy in different sectors.
                Our second graph is a stacked area chart which shows the CO2 emissions by sector. 
                The last two graphs show the US population growth compared with the economic growth over time. 
                It explores those variables as possible causes of the increase in energy consumption.

                Energy consumption will continue to increase as we continue to have technological progress. 
                However, with greener forms of energy such as wind, solar, and water, we can minimize the impact that energy consumption has on the environment.
                With more efficient systems as well as global legislation and collaborative efforts to reduce these emissions, we can see that there is truly a bright future in store for us and our planet.

                It was difficult to use the data at first, because of how we wanted to structure our visualizations, so we ended up with multiple csv files that reformat the data.
                It took us awhile to figure out how to implement it smoothly and have the files complement each other.

            <li>
                It was also challenging to coordinate the visualizations with each other. 
                Initially, our website was not very cohesive.
